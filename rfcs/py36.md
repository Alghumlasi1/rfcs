# End support for Python 3.6

## Summary

[Support for Python 3.6](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches)
ends on 2021-12-23. When official support has ended, web-platform-tests will stop
being testing with Python 3.6, and depending on Python 3.7 features will be allowed.

## Details

The immediate motivation for this is that Azure Pipelines no longer supports
Python 3.6 on macOS 11, meaning that we can no longer easily test Python 3.6 on macOS.
In order to test the same minimum Python version on all platforms, the version used on
Taskcluster also needs to be bumped to 3.7, which amounts to ending support for 3.6.

Timeline:

- Immediately: Azure Pipelines on macOS and Windows is upgraded from Python 3.6 to 3.7
- Between Dec 6 and Dec 17: Taskcluster is upgraded from Python 3.6 to 3.7
- After Dec 23: Support for testing Python 3.6 is removed throughout WPT

## Risks

Some downstream users of WPT may still be using Python 3.6. TODO, confirm with:

- [ ] Chromium
- [ ] Gecko
- [ ] WebKit
